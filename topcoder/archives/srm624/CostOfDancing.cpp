// PROBLEM STATEMENT
/* Gustavo studies at the Byteversity (one of the best universities in Byteland). He's also very keen on dancing, so he decided to enroll at a dance school.

The school offers many different courses, each teaching one dance. Different courses may have different costs. You are given a vector <int> danceCost. The elements of danceCost are the costs of all courses offered at the dance school.

Gustavo would like to learn exactly K of those dances. He is a poor student, so his only priority is to pay as little as possible for the courses.

You are given the int K and the vector <int> danceCost. Compute and return the smallest possible total cost of learning K dances.

DEFINITION
Class:CostOfDancing
Method:minimum
Parameters:int, vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int minimum(int K, vector <int> danceCost)


CONSTRAINTS
-danceCost will contain between 1 and 1,000 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of danceCost will be between 1 and 1,000, inclusive.
-K will be between 1 and the number of elements in danceCost, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
2
{1, 5, 3, 4}

Returns: 4

Gustavo must pay for exactly two out of the four given courses. The cheapest possibility is to pay 1 for one course and then 3 for another course. The total cost is 1+3 = 4.

1)
3
{1, 5, 4}

Returns: 10

Gustavo has no choice here. He has to pay for all three courses, which costs 1+5+4 = 10.

2)
1
{2, 2, 4, 5, 3}

Returns: 2

Among all 5 possible courses he can take, the cheapest one is either the course #0 or course #1 (0-based).

3)
39
{973, 793, 722, 573, 521, 568, 845, 674, 595, 310, 284, 794, 913, 93, 129, 758, 108, 433, 181, 163, 96, 932,
 703, 989, 884, 420, 615, 991, 364, 657, 421, 336, 801, 142, 908, 321, 709, 752, 346, 656, 413, 629, 801}

Returns: 20431
